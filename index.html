					Arya Doge Coin: To thank a dog named Arya

I’m Jorge Timón, the developer of Arya Doge Coin. Maybe none of you heard of my name, but I worked as a blockchain developer since 2011, and I’m still in it. It was great to see the success of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and many other projects. And I’m appreciated to be one of the developers, contributed to the open-source projects of Bitcoin and Dogecoin. It may mean nothing to the project, but it means a lot to me. I worked on my own project in 2011, and spent near 3 years to built a crypto called Freicoin. I failed unfortunately. And our team was dismissed. I was down bad because my team and I put too much effort on it. I can’t sleep well, felt depressed, and I even stopped talking to people… The good news is that this situation didn’t last long. One, I visited a pet store and met my angle, Arya. He was jumping, leaping and spinning around me. And I decided to take him home. He’s so smart and he can understand me easily. I talk to him every day, tell him how’s my day, whatever good or bad. Sometimes he can even respond me lol. He’s my best friend and family. He really cured me and gave me courage to flight for my dream. Arya has been with me for 7 years. He’s turning old and I’m not the young Jorge anymore. I won’t be who I am today without Arya. That’s why I named this project with “Arya Doge Coin”, to appreciate the good days with him, to share my story and experience with all of you.	</div>
